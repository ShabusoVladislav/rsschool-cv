### About myself
My goal presently is to complete *Stage#0* in __RS School__ and continue my education in **BSU, MMF**.
After graduating from the university I want to be a _Web developer_.
But now I need to learn HTML, CSS, JS and it's frameworks and libraries as well as I can.

### My skills
My knowledge base not so big, but I know some programming languages:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* C++
* Kotlin
* Photoshop

### Code examples
1. C++
```c++
int intersection(clCircle *crc, int ncrc) {
	int n=0;
	for(int i=0; i<ncrc; i++)
		if(crc[i].dist(x, y) <= radius) n++;
	return n;
};
```
2. JS
```js
submitFunc = () => {
    const newObjFields = trAddElement.children
    let objWithInfo = {}
    for(let i = 0; i < newObjFields.length - 1; i++) {
	objWithInfo[newObjFields[i].className] = newObjFields[i].firstElementChild.value
	newObjFields[i].firstElementChild.value = ''
    }
    arr.push(objWithInfo)
    refresh(arr)
}
```

### Education and work experience
Now I'm a second year student at **BSU, MMF**. I have been learning web programming for one year and made a [small resume with my works](https://shabusovladislav.github.io/Resume/)

### English level
I believe that my english level is about **A2**. At the university I had the maximum mark (ten).
